        here you can play Set, this was my attempt to make a simple card game with just html,css and Javascript.<br><br>
        The goal of the game is to take the most number of “Sets” possible where a set consists of:<br>
3 cards are a Set if the characteristic (shape, color, number, shading) is the same or distinct
for each of the cards.
